# adding a big noop sled before the shellcode so the return address doesnâ€™t have to be super precise
# can no longer write the return address into it bc we don't know the exact offset
# aren't subtracting 54 bc we have 2 byte noop --> subtracting 56
# need to add code so that no matter how the stack organizes itself, I am always returning the entire shellcode
# writing to the address of the shellcode
